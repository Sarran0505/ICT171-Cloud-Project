# 🥋 Sarran Dojo - Cloud Deployment Project

Welcome to my **Sarran Dojo** project. 
I created a website for karate and kickboxing classes, bringing my passion for martial arts!

## 📌What did I do?


  --> Spun up an **AWS EC2** server running **Ubuntu 22.04**  
  --> Installed **Apache2** to serve my HTML/CSS website  
  --> Set up **SSL/TLS** with Let’s Encrypt
  --> Hooked up a custom domain with **DuckDNS**: [sarran-dojo.duckdns.org](https://sarran-dojo.duckdns.org)  
  --> Wrote a tiny **check_ports.sh** Bash script to check open ports
